Premium Packages is a free full-featured WordPress eCommerce Plugin to sell digital products easily.

== Description ==

Use WPDM - Premium Packages plugin to convert your [Download Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/download-manager/) into a complete e-Commerce Solution for selling digital products. Simply put a price when you need to sell a digital item. You also may use license  ( ex: Simple, Extended, Unlimited ) based prices for a product. Users can directly download free items and when an item has a price user will have to go through cart & checkout. WordPress Download Manager has the easiest checkout option to give the user better experience in purchasing an item and which always increase the probability of successful completion of an order.

= Features =
WordPress Download Manager & Premium Package Add-on gives you the perfect WordPress Digital Store Solution to convert your site into a digital store just in a few clicks:

= Shopping Cart =
Full featured shopping cart with integrated PayPal payment system to sell your packages/products.
Full-featured order management system to manage orders for premium packages. (premium package add-on)

= Order & Invoice Management =
Extended order and invoice management options, multiple invoice templates with customization options.
WordPress Download Manager Sales Report

= Sales Report =
A full detailed report on sale and orders. Generate custom chart or graph report for site-wide sales or shop specific or product specific sale easily.
WordPress Download Manager Mobile App

= Mobile Apps =
Yes, get everything in your pocket, check sales report from your mobile, get notifications on each sale directly on your mobile.

= Coupon Management =
The Plugin includes an extensive range of coupon management. You can create product specific coupons or global coupons for different levels of discount.

= Role-Based Discount =
Sometimes you may need to apply different discounts based on user roles, like editors and authors may have different percents of discounts.

= Product & Price Variation =
Unlimited Product Variations. Create single or multiple variations ( i.e. licenses types ) with increments or decrements of the base price. Also, sale individual or selective files from a package, like selling single or selective music from an album. FYI, only wpdm v4

= Get Free or Pay As You Want / Donate =
You can sell a product with "As you want to pay" option, you also can set a minimum amount to pay or simply put 0 for a minimum price if you want to keep the minimum price optional ( allow users to download even for free ).

= Accept Payment Without Creating Product =
We know, sometimes you need to request/accept payment from someone, and you want to keep track of this inside your site, and creating a product may feel too much of work, so you can simply create a dynamic pay link or use shortocde `[wpdmpp_pay_link price="59" name="Reason for payment" desc="You may add more details" cssclass="btn btn-primary" recurring=0]`

= Sell Extra Gigs =
You may offer additional services like installation, priority support & maintenance for additional fees like extra gigs with your main products, a customer may select one or more gigs with main product and the extra price will be added with the main product price.

= The Simplest Checkout Option =
Premium Package Add-on introduced the simplest checkout system ever, no complex steps, both guests' and members' checkout just exactly in 2 clicks.

= Abandoned Cart/Order Recovery =
Premium Package Add-on has an easy-to-use feature to recover abandoned carts/orders, you can configure this feature to send upto 5 emails to the potential customer at different intervals. It also can add dynamic coupon at the end to inspire the customer to complete the checkout as last attempt.

= Save & Email Cart =
Add items to your cart, you can save it to complete the purchase later or email the saved cart to someone you want to pay for the items.

= Dynamic Product =
Need to accept quick payment through your site? Now, you even don't have to create a product anymore, Premium Package's dynamic product feature enables you to accept any one time or recurring payment just on the fly.

= Software Licensing =
Integrated Software Licensing option with this Digital Store add-on gives you a complete license key generation, key activation, and verification system.

= Automatic Order Expiration =
Premium Package Add-on has an option to set up a custom access period for the purchased items. Like if you provide 1-year free update of your software after someone purchases your digital item, you can set order expiration period 365 days and after 1 year ( 365 days ) customer will not be able to access his purchase, the order status will be expired, and he will have a "renew order" option in order details page.

= Automatic Order Renew =
As you already read, Premium Package has an "Automatic Order Expiration" option, probably you are wondering where is "Automatic Order Renew". Good news is, Premium Package has this feature too. If you enable the auto-renewal feature, on checkout the payment will be like a subscription/recurring payment and order will be renewed automatically at the end of each expiration period ( subscription-based pricing model ). Of course, you also can enable an order expiration and auto-renewal notification email for customers before you charge them.

= Easy Tax Option =
We have made the tax calculation is easier for you. From premium package settings, you can easily set up tax for different countries/states/cities just in few clicks.
